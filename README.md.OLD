# No Man's Guide

A second-screen companion app for the game "No Man's Sky." A convenient way to see location, crafting, and cooking data for over one hundred in-game items (and growing). Future updates tentatively include translations for the various alien languages.

## Installation
1. Clone this repository and provision a web server for the project.
2. Get a TinyPNG Developer API key from [TinyPNG - Developer API](https://tinypng.com/developers).
3. Make a copy of `.env-example`, rename to `.env`, and update the value of `TINYPNG_API_KEY` with the actual key.
3. Make sure [Node.js](https://nodejs.org) and [NPM](https://www.npmjs.com) are installed.
4. In the project's root directory, run `npm install` in the terminal.

## Development
1. Run `gulp` to auto-prefix and minify the CSS, minify the JavaScript, and to set a watcher on these files so that the same is done automatically when changes are saved.
2. `CTRL+C` in the console will quit the watch process.

This project is tested with BrowserStack.
